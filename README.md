# AgentCode Chatbot â€“ Finetuned Conversational AI

Welcome to the AgentCode Chatbot repository! This project hosts a custom conversational agent finetuned on domain-specific data to enhance alignment, responsiveness, and contextual understanding in dialogue systems.

## ðŸ¤– Overview

This chatbot is designed to demonstrate improved alignment behavior in AI agents. It has been finetuned using curated datasets that emphasize instruction-following, ethical reasoning, and nuanced conversational flow. The model is optimized for modular integration and can be deployed in research or production environments.

## ðŸ“š Training Data

The finetuning dataset includes:
- **Instructional prompts**: Covering diverse user intents and task types.
- **Conversational turns**: Multi-turn dialogues with alignment-focused annotations.
- **Ethical dilemmas and reasoning tasks**: To improve moral and contextual judgment.
- **Tool usage examples**: For agents that interact with external APIs or plugins.

The data was preprocessed to ensure consistency, safety, and relevance to alignment research goals.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The chatbot is built on a transformer-based language model (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, or GPT-style), enhanced with:
- **LoRA adapters** for efficient finetuning
- **PEFT techniques** to reduce memory footprint
- **Custom callbacks** for modular tool invocation and logging

## ðŸš€ Features

- Context-aware multi-turn dialogue
- Modular tool integration (e.g., search, calculator, plugins)
- Ethical alignment and refusal behavior
- Configurable personality and tone

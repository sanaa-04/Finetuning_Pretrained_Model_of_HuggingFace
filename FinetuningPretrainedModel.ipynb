              "  \" The Dictionary Data Type\\n\\nA dictionary in Python is a versatile data structure that shares similarities but also has differences from lists. Unlike lists, which rely on integer values for indices, dictionaries can utilize diverse data types for indexes, these are called keys. When a key is connected to an associated value, it is referred to as a key-value pair.\\n\\nA dictionary is created with the use of braces `{}`. \\n\\nConsider the following example: \\n\\n```python\\nmyCat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'disposition': 'loud'}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, a dictionary is assigned to the variable `myCat`. The dictionary comprises three key-value pairs. The keys are 'size', 'color', and 'disposition'. These keys in the dictionary are associated with the values 'fat', 'gray' and 'loud' respectively. \\n\\nAccess to these values can be achieved via their keys. \\n\\nLet's denote how:\\n\\n```python\\nprint(myCat['size'])\\n```\\n\\nWhen you execute this line of code, Python identifies the key 'size' within the given dictionary `myCat` and returns the corresponding value which in this case, is 'fat'.\\n\\nDefining a dictionary is straightforward - you just equate a variable to `{}` or `{key: value}` pair. Moreover, accessing stored data in dictionary is efficient and quick because keys directly point to their associated values. Hence, dictionaries in Python serve as an efficient data structure to maintain and manage data.\",\n",

The first item in a list named spam would be spam[0]. But there is no “first” item in a dictionary.

              "  \" Introduction to Python Dictionaries\\n\\nIn this section of the textbook, we will guide you through one of the core aspects of Python programming – dictionaries. We will explore how dictionaries work, their functionalities, and by the end of this chapter, you will have mastered how to manipulate dictionaries to your advantage.\\n\\nA python dictionary is a data structure that holds an unordered collection of elements, each identified by a unique key. Dictionaries are unordered, mutable and indexed. They are written with curly brackets `{}` and have keys and values separated by a colon `:`. The keys in a python dictionary are unique. Values are accessed by their corresponding keys.\\n\\n```python\\nmyCat = {'color': 'gray', 'size': 'fat'}\\n```\\nIn the above example, we have a dictionary called `myCat` with two key-value pairs. The keys are 'color' and 'size', whereas their corresponding values are 'gray' and 'fat'. To access a specific value from a dictionary, we pass the corresponding key inside the square brackets.\\n\\nMethods `keys()` and `values()` are used to return the keys and values in the dictionary.\\n\\n```python\\nprint(myCat.keys())   Output: ['color', 'size']\\nprint(myCat.values())   Output: ['gray', 'fat']\\n```\\n\\n Accessing Values in a Dictionary\\n\\n```python\\nprint(myCat['size'])\\n```\\n\\nThe above line of code will output `fat`, the value attached to the key `size`.\\n\\nWe can also use dictionary values in expressions. For example, let's prepare a string sentence using a key from `myCat` dictionary:\\n\\n```python\\nprint('My cat has ' + myCat['color'] + ' fur.')\\n```\\n\\nIt prints `My cat has gray fur.`. In the example above, `myCat['color']` is replaced by its corresponding value from the dictionary, which is `gray`.\\n\\n Using Integers as Dictionary Keys\\n\\nDictionaries can use integer values as keys, not unlike lists which use integers for indexes. However, dictionary keys don't have to start at 0 and can be any number.\\n\\n```python\\nspam = {12345: 'Luggage Combination', 42: 'The Answer'}\\n```\\n\\nIn this given example, the `spam` dictionary uses integers as keys and strings as values.\\n\\n Dictionaries versus Lists\\n\\nA key aspect that differentiates dictionaries from lists is that dictionaries are unordered. Whereas the first item in a list would be accessed using `list[0]`, there is no “first” item in a dictionary. While the order in which items appear might be essential in a list, it does not matter in which order the key-value pairs are typed in a dictionary. The order doesn't define any priority or sequences among items in a dictionary, unlike lists. \\n\\nIn conclusion, dictionaries are incredibly useful for storing data in python, thanks to their key-value structure. Understanding how to create, access, and manipulate dictionaries is a vital part of becoming proficient with Python.\",\n",
              "  \">>> spam = ['cats', 'dogs', 'moose']\\n>>> bacon = ['dogs', 'moose', 'cats']\\n>>> spam == bacon\\nFalse\\n>>> eggs = {'name': 'Zophie', 'species': 'cat', 'age': '8'}\\n>>> ham = {'species': 'cat', 'age': '8', 'name': 'Zophie'}\\n>>> eggs == ham\\nTrue\\nBecause dictionaries are not ordered, they can’t be sliced like lists.\\nTrying to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary will result in a KeyError error message, much like a list’s “out-of-range” IndexError error message. Enter the following into the interactive shell, and notice the error message that shows up because there is no 'color' key:\"]}"

            "\n",
            "PyPDF2 is a Python library for reading and writing PDF files. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating and manipulating PDF documents. Here are some basic operations you can perform with PyPDF2:\n",
            "\n",
            "Creating a PDF file:\n",
            "\n",
            "To create a new PDF file using PyPDF2, you can use the `open()` function and pass it a file name as the first argument, followed by the content of the PDF file as a string. Here's an example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "import PyPDF2\n",
            "\n",
            "# Create a new PDF file\n",

            "```\n",
            "In this example, we create a new PDF file named `example.pdf` and add a single page to it. The `add_page()` method is used to add a page to the PDF file, and the `save()` method is used to save the file.\n",

            "Handling PDF files:\n",
            "\n",
            "To handle an existing PDF file, you can use the `open()` function in the same way as when creating a new file. Here's an example:\n",
            "```\n",
            "import PyPDF2\n",

            "# Close the file\n",

            "In this example, we open an existing PDF file named `example.pdf` and read its contents using the `getPage()` method. The `extractText()` method is used to extract the text from the first page of the PDF file, and the `print()` function is used to display the contents.\n",
